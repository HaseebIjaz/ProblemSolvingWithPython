# Two Sum

## Problem Statement:

- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

- You can return the answer in any order.

## Important Points To Note:

1. Return indices means return an array since it is plural
2. Each input can have exactly one solution meaning that we can use an approach we can return immediately if we find the solution
3. Order does not matter

## Insight:

1. We need to understand if someone stresses wether someone is giving us a choice that it can have only one solution , which means that we can think about the greedy solution or a solution which comes first and just return.
